### Sales Data Analysis using Pandas and Python - EDA
#### Overview:
Analyzed Sales data using the Pandas library in Python and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the sales trends, patterns, and performance metrics

### Steps:
#### 1.Data Loading: 
Loading the sales dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, and merging 12 months sales data

#### 2.Data Cleaning: 
Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data. This step ensures the data is accurate and reliable for analysis.

#### 3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Explored the distribution of sales metrics such as revenue, quantity sold, and profit.
Analyzed sales trends over time (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly).
Investigate relationships between different variables (e.g., sales vs. advertising spend, sales by product category).
Identify top-performing products, regions, or sales representatives.
Visualization: visualizations (e.g., line plots, bar charts, heatmaps) to present insights and trends visually.

Summary Statistics: Computed summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) to quantify key metrics and performance indicators.
